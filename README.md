# Redmine Sudo plugin

This plugin allows administrators of a redmine instance to change their rights temporarily and navigate as if they were normal users. Then they can take back their administrator rights only when needed. It's the same idea as "sudo" in Linux/Unix operating systems, you don't need to be root all the time.
